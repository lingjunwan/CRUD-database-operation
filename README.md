# CRUD database operation
This CRUD-oriented services project was for practice from <a href url= "https://continuingeducation.johnabbott.qc.ca/programs/full-stack-developer/"> Full-Stack Developer Web Services 420-WD4-AB</a>.  
CRUD database operations refer to the basic functions that allow you to create, retrieve, update, and delete data from a database.   
In this project, we connect to MySQL as the database and Postman is used to do the CRUD operations.
